## About

The controllers dialog allow to add synchronized controllers between the users of the session. The added controls can be controlled by MIDI via the MIDI learn widget (see *User Interface* section).

Many type of controls can be added by entering an uniform name and choosing the GLSL type.

This is a deprecated feature and is no longer enabled within Fragment, it is replaced by OSC.
