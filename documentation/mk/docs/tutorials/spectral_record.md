## About

The spectral recording dialog is a continuous recording of the slices content with simple additive, substractive or multiply compositing.

The recording can be exported to an image or imported back into Fragment as an input.

Importing the record to Fragment allow to play it back and manipulate it (pitch shifting etc.), it is the same concept as audio samples except that it work with images data instead of audio data.
