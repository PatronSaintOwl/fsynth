## About

The spectral recording dialog is a continuous recording of the slices content with compositing functions (add, mul, sub).

The recording can be exported to a .PNG image, saved to disk as a .WAV file or imported back into Fragment as an input.

The export to .WAV can be very handy since the exported file will be named with 100% accurate fundamental frequency informations along with the note name, session and current date, this can be a very powerful tool to constitute a samples library or as a source for Fragment granular synthesis.

Note : .WAV export **only use additive synthesis**

Importing the record to Fragment allow to play it back and manipulate it (pitch shifting etc.), it is the same concept as audio samples except that it work with images data instead of audio data.
