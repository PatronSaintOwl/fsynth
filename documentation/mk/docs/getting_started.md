## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is to join/create a session on the [homepage](https://www.fsynth.com)

To output any sounds the audio server available on the [homepage](https://www.fsynth.com) must be downloaded and installed.

To install the audio server on Ubuntu/Debian system :

- Download the .deb package on the [homepage](https://www.fsynth.com)
- In a terminal `sudo apt install ./fragment_2.0_amd64.deb`

Once the session is created, you will join automatically the Fragment application, an example code which produce basic sounds will be provided automatically along with a quickstart guide.

The Fragment user interface layout is made of :

- an information bar at the top
- the canvas which is the accelerated drawing surface
- a toolbar
- the project sidebar alongside code editor where the GPU can be instructed to draw on the canvas

To hear any sounds, you must **unpause** by clicking on the corresponding toolbar buttion, then slice the canvas in vertical chunks to capture the pixels produced by the example code, you can do that by **right-clicking anywhere on the canvas** and then by **clicking on the + icon**.

If you hear a simple 440hz tone, congratulations! Time to move on to the tutorial!

If you want to quickly explore you can find many snippets of most features in the project sidebar.
