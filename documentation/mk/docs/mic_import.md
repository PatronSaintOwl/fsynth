## About

Microphone output can be captured in real-time by using the associated import dialog button.

The microphone data is converted to a spectrum image (Fourrier Transform) in real-time from left to right.

The time / frequency resolution of the resulting spectogram can be controlled by increasing or decreasing the **Mic. FFT size** in the import dialog **Mic** pane.

## How-to

To use the microphone data, see *images import* section for the usage of images
