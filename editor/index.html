     Welcome to Fragment - The Collaborative Spectral Synthesizer

     This is a sample program which produce a 440 Hz tone and a basic sawtooth like waveform and timbre when played by a MIDI keyboard.

     Please use a MIDI enabled browser such as Chrome and enable your MIDI keyboard in the MIDI settings dialog to hear the timbre (the MIDI plug icon)

     The software documentation is available at : https://www.fsynth.com/documentation

     Fragment interface is composed of four parts :
       - info. panel/global settings at the top
       - a graphical score
       - a toolbar
       - a GLSL code editor

     Hover over an interface element for a short description of that element.

     Now, if you want to hear what you see, you should try to right click on the graphical score,
     a menu will be shown with one item, add a slice by clicking on the [+] icon.

     You should hear something now, try to move the vertical slice by clicking on it, hold it then move the cursor around.

     You can add as many slices as you want, you can also remove, mute or tweak slices by right-clicking on one.

     You can experiment right away with the sound/visual by tweaking the values of this sample program, any modifications is updated in real-time as you type.

     If you need some more help you can :
       - Click on the ? icon
       - Post on the Fragment message board at https://quiet.fsynth.com

     You can find all the sessions you joined in by going on the homepage at https://www.fsynth.com

     Don't forget that you can invite friends to join your session by sharing the link shown in the adress bar.

     Note : Image/Webcam inputs are not implemented collaboratively, the images or webcam you add can be seen by you only!

     Have fun!
